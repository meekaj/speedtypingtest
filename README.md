# Python Typing Speed Test

This project is a simple Python application designed to help users measure their typing speed and accuracy. The application generates a random sentence from a predefined list, and users must type the sentence as accurately and quickly as possible.

## Features

- **Random Sentence Generation**: Users type out a sentence randomly chosen from a predefined list.
- **User-Initiated Start**: Users decide when to start typing by pressing the Enter key, allowing them to prepare before the timer starts.
- **Performance Metrics**: After typing, the program displays the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and accuracy percentage.
- **Repeatability**: Users can repeat the test as many times as they like.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you'll need:
- Python 3.x installed on your computer. 

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**:
2. No external libraries are required for this program, as it uses Python's built-in random and time modules.

### Usage
Upon running the program, a sentence will be displayed.
Press Enter when you are ready to start.
Type the sentence as it appears and hit Enter when completed.
The program will then display your typing speed in WPM and accuracy percentage.
To take the test again, respond with 'y' when prompted if you want to try again.

### Academic Context
This project was developed as a part of a first-year university final project.
